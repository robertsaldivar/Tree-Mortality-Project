###For drought calculation: needs precipitation data in MONTHS for the entire time range AND the [timestep] years prior to the start of that range
#the FIRST value in this (i.e. index = 1) should be from [timestep] years before the intended start time
#by default we'll use the testing data available from the SPEI library
data(balance)
PMinusPET = balance$tampa
#there isn't enough data by default for 100 years
###For grazing calculation: needs the INITIAL herbivore POPULATION COUNT
herb_n = 200
####Written by Kaili:
# biomass scaling data frame
  ## We also need a biomass scaling data frame, which has age class-specific scaling factors. 
  ## For example, each individual in age class 1 has an average biomass (g C) of 0.5, etc. This 
  ## will help us convert between # of individuals and amount of biomass.
  biomassscaling <- data.frame("age_class" = c(1:10), "scaling" = c(1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7,

# alpha data frame
  ## Alpha values represents the "feeding rate" or "effect" of herbivores on trees, in each age 
  ## class. Because most full grown herbivores (deer) can likely eat the leaves of an entire 
  ## individual in age classes 1 and 2, we will assign higher alpha values to the smaller age 
  ## classes and lower alpha values to the larger age classes
  alphascaling <- data.frame("age_class" = c(1:10), "alpha" = c(0.0009, 0.0008, 0.0007, 0.00006, 0.00006, 0.00006,
