###For drought calculation: needs precipitation data in MONTHS for the entire time range AND the [timestep] years prior to the start of that range
#the FIRST value in this (i.e. index = 1) should be from [timestep] years before the intended start time

#by default we'll use the testing data available from the SPEI library
data(balance)
PMinusPET = balance$tampa
#there isn't enough data by default for 100 years


###For grazing calculation: needs the INITIAL herbivore BIOMASS
herb_n = 200
```

```{r model setup}
#initialize results matrix
pops = data.frame(t(initialpops))
colnames(pops) = c("0-9","10-19","20-29","30-39","40-49","50-59","60-69","70-79","80-89","90-99")
pops[2:(t+1),]=0
#initialize the age matrix
age_matrix = matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = length(initialpops)) #only really need 2 rows:
  #1st row is for fertility rates
  #2nd row is for death rates
  #the columns represent the age bins
age_matrix[]  = 0
age_matrix[1,] = fert_rates
age_matrix[2,] = mort_rates
```

```{r test grazing submodel}
test = grazingsubmodel(herb_n,pops[1,]) #it 'works' but amount lost is higher than the population for the default values 
```

``` {r model loop}
#for the desired time length:
for(i in 1:t) { #run 1 timestep of the model
  #at the start of a timestep the survivability matrix is:
  # Fertility row:  [whatever the fertility rate set above is]
  # Death rows:     0 0 0 0 0
  #                 0 0 0 0 0
  #                 ...
  
  #we will need to reset the death rows to just the age-related death fractions
  age_matrix[2,]=mort_rates
  
  #get the herbivore related deaths/rates [what should be returned is either:
  #1. The fraction of trees that die - from herbivory only - in each age class for a single timestep, OR
  #2. The NUMBER of trees that die - from herbivory only - in each age class for a SINGLE timestep
  
  
  
  #It would be ideal for this model to also return the new ACTUAL HERBIVORE POPULATION at the end of a single timestep,
  #but if it returns something like herbivore deaths or death rate than that can be handled here too
  
  #I am assuming here that it returns the fraction that die of herbivory during the timestep as well as the growth and death numbers (not rates) for the herbivore population

  #each +1 to i is +12 to the drought index we want
  #on 1st timestep we want from 1 to 12, which is i to 12i
